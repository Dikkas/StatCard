## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- media screen


### What I learned

If I want to add an image with a color then see below:

```css
.image{
    background-color: hsla(277, 64%, 61%, 0.65);
    background-blend-mode: multiply;
    background-image: url("image-header-mobile.jpg");
}
```

### Continued development

I need to focus more on the Flex.
Also, I struggled a bit when trying to work with background-image and background-color and Flex (Need to set a Height, otherwise didn't work).
